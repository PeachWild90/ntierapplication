Repositories
1 - build it out - skeleton style - main, streamingcontent, repository, and programUI
2 - program.Run() in main
3 - built constructors in StreamingContent Method
4 - Went into Stream Content Repository
	-we want to make it PRIVATE!! not Public
	-We call the methods...not the lists
	-the only access you have is what youve built out
	-i wanna add/remove this from list
5 - went into ProgramUI and did a bunch of stuff
	-Run program() ==> RunMenu()
	-CreatShow()
	-PASS IT DOWN TO REPOSITORY AT THE END
	-Now we must get our list from repository back to UI
		-we gotta get the list out from repository!!
		-make a method that returns our list (from its return type)
		-GetContentList in Repository!
6- be sure to pass in parameter content to Repository
