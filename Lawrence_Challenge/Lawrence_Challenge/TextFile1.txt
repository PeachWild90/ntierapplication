Krunker Eo Incoporated needs a console application for business 
operations. Krunker Eo Inc is a educational video streaming site 
for programming languages. 
Krunker is outdated and they have to manually register users. 
Krunker needs to be able to obtain user information; first name, 
last name, Birthday (must be a datetime), address. 
Krunker needs to know how many videos the user is buying.
They want to store the user information in a list and be able to remove users as needed. 
They want to display the user information sorted by last name. 
Based on how many videos the user is purchasing the owed total needs to be stored 
in the list, videos are $10.00 each. 
In order to ensure Krunker that our application is working we need to Unit test
our methods in our repository.
